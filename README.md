by justinh00k

## Instructions
Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens. Login, and allow permission to `repo: Full control of private repositories.` Generate a token. Copy and store this token if you will be needing it again in the future - it will not be stored in Github.

Clone this repo, and launch it with @yarnpkg by typing `yarn start` in your terminal or command line.

Enter your token in the box, click the button. You will see a list of repos you have access to. Click one to see its issues.

You can sort issues ascending or descending by clicking on the column headings.

## Issues
File issues or contact the developer directly.
